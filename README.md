# Single_Cycle_MIPS
A 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor based on Harvard Architecture. The single-cycle microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one cycle. Top module is divided into a datapath unit, a control unit interfaced to external memory. The processor was tested using two programs: A Factorial of a number and GCD of two numbers. Both was written in machine code and loaded into the instruction memory
